Q1) What is a log drain?

Log Drains let you collect stdout and stderr logs from your apps and databases deployed on PCF and route them to a log destination.
Pivotal Cloud Foundry does not persist logs. For long term storage of logs, drain logs to a third party log management service

Q2) How do you create one?
Create a User Provided Service Instance that streams logs to Papertrail.
 cf create-user-provided-service LOG-DRAIN -l syslog://<SYSLOG-DRAIN-URL>

 Bind the log-drain service to the  application.
 cf bind-service APP-NAME LOG-DRAIN 

Q3) Why would you use it?
Visualize your logs
Filter /search and store for long term audits

Q4) What is “Syslog”?
Cloud Foundry uses the syslog URL to route messages to the service. The syslog URL has a scheme of syslog, syslog-tls, or https, and can include a port number. For example:
syslog://logs.example.com:1234
Elastic Runtime does not support using syslog-tls with self-signed certificates. If you are running your own syslog server and want to use syslog-tls, you must have an SSL certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority.
