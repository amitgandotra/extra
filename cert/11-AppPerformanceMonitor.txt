Q1) What is performance monitoring? How is it implemented for Cloud Foundry applications?
As a prerequisite to PCF monitoring, you need an account with a monitoring platform such as SignalFx, Datadog, OpenTDSB, New Relic, vRealize Operations (vROPS), AppDynamics, or another tool.

To set up PCF monitoring, you then configure PCF and your monitoring platform as follows:

In PCF:
Install a nozzle that extracts BOSH and CF metrics from the Firehose and sends them to the monitoring platform.
(Optional) Deploy smoke tests or other apps that generate custom metrics. Pivotal recommends custom metrics for production environments.
In your monitoring platform:
Customize a dashboard that lets you check and diagnose system health.
Create alerts that generate communications regarding attention-worthy conditions.
